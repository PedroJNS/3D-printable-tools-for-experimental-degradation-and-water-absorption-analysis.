# Degradation Rate & Water Absorption Analysis

This repository contains 3D-printable models and analysis tools for the experimental evaluation of material degradation rates and water absorption behavior. It is intended to support reproducible laboratory testing and post-processing of experimental data.

# Overview
The project provides:
- 3D-printable specimen models designed for degradation and water absorption experiments
- Utilities for processing, visualizing, and interpreting experimental results

These tools are suitable for materials research applications such as polymers, composites, and related systems exposed to environmental or aging conditions.

# 3D-Printable Models
The models are designed to:
- Enable consistent sample geometry
- Facilitate controlled degradation and water absorption measurements
- Be compatible with standard FDM/FFF or SLA 3D printers
Recommended printing parameters (material, infill, orientation) may be specified in the model folder or accompanying documentation.

# Applications
- Material degradation studies
- Water uptake and diffusion analysis
- Aging and durability assessment
- Experimental method development
